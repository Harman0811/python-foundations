# BASIC NOTES:

# These are one of the control flow statements in the pragramming languages and this helps in controlling the flow in a program or a block of the code by providing the addition of the conditions in the code.

# Conditional statements are used to make decisions in a program.
# They allow the program to execute different blocks of code
# depending on whether a condition is True or False.

# Main keywords:
# - if      → checks a condition
# - elif    → checks another condition if previous is False
# - else    → runs if all above conditions are False
#
# Important:
# - Indentation is mandatory in Python
# - Conditions must return True or False
