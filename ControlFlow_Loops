# BASIC NOTES:

# Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times.

# Types of loops in Python:
1. for loop   → used when number of iterations is known
 2. while loop → used when condition-based repetition is needed

# Important keywords:
# - break    → exits the loop completely
# - continue → skips current iteration
# - range()  → generates a sequence of numbers


print(" FOR LOOP EXAMPLE ")

# for loop with range(start, stop)
for i in range(1, 6):
    print("Number:", i)


print(" FOR LOOP WITH LIST ")

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"]

# loop through list
for fruit in fruits:
    print("Fruit:", fruit)


print(" WHILE LOOP EXAMPLE ")

count = 1

# runs while condition is True
while count <= 5:
    print("Count:", count)
    count += 1  # very important (otherwise infinite loop)


print(" EVEN NUMBERS USING FOR LOOP ")

# print even numbers from 1 to 10
for num in range(1, 11):
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print(num, "is even")


print(" BREAK EXAMPLE ")

# break stops the loop completely
for i in range(1, 10):
    if i == 5:
        print("Loop stopped at", i)
        break
    print("i =", i)


print(" CONTINUE EXAMPLE ")

# continue skips current iteration
for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 3:
        continue
    print("i =", i)


print(" SIMPLE MULTIPLICATION TABLE ")

number = 5

for i in range(1, 11):
    print(f"{number} x {i} = {number * i}")



# QUICK SUMMARY:

# for loop → used for fixed repetitions
# while loop → used for condition-based loops
# break → exits loop
# continue → skips one iteration
# range() → generates numbers
