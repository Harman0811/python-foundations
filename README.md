# python-foundations

Hi, I'm **Harmandeep kaur**, a **BSc Data Science** student.

This repository contains my foundational practice in Python. It reflects my understanding of core programming concepts that are essential for Data Science and software development.

## About This Repository

This project covers the fundamental concepts of Python programming, including:

* Variables and Data Types
* Input and Output
* Conditional Statements (if-else)
* Loops (for, while)
* Functions
* Data Structures (Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries)
* Exception Handling
* File Handling

The goal of this repository is to build a strong programming foundation before moving into advanced Data Science topics like NumPy, Pandas, and Machine Learning.
