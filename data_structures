**What Are Data Structures in Python?**

Data structures are ways to store, organize, and manage data efficiently so that it can be used easily in a program.

**Think of it like:**

If data is clothes

Data structure is the cupboard/organizer 

Without proper structure, data becomes messy and hard to work with.

Why Data Structures Matter

**They help you:**

Store multiple values

Access data quickly

Modify data easily

Write efficient programs

Handle real-world data

**Main Data Structures in Python**

Python has built-in data structures you’ll use all the time.

**1️ List**

Ordered, mutable collection

numbers = [10, 20, 30]

Features:

Ordered 

Changeable (mutable) 

Allows duplicates 

Used when: you need a flexible collection

**2️ Tuple**

Ordered but immutable collection

coordinates = (10, 20)

Features:

Ordered 

Not changeable 

Allows duplicates 

Used when: data should not change

**3️ Set**

Unordered collection of unique items

unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3}

Features:

Unordered 

No duplicates 

Mutable 

Used when: you need unique values

**4️ Dictionary**

Stores data in key–value pairs

student = {
    "name": "Rahul",
    "age": 20
}

Features:

Key–value based 

Fast lookup 

Mutable 

Keys must be unique 

Used when: data has labels (like columns)
